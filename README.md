# MLB Pitcher Data Analysis Project for MGSC310
## Emily Nguyen

### Project Description:

This project analyzes MLB pitchers' stats from 2015-2023, including the number of home runs and RBIs given up, walk and strike percentage, pitch count, and more.
This dataset was used to answer the following question:

**Can we predict a pitcher’s earned run average (ERA) based on their performance metrics?**

By leveraging the model, teams can enhance scouting efforts, streamline player development programs, and make more informed decisions during crucial moments in games.
Additionally, these predictive insights, like predicting a pitcher’s ERA can guide salary negotiations and contract decisions.
While there are still some teams and managers in the league who are hesitant to use data-driven decisions, embracing predictive analytics can help understand and enhance player capabilities.
